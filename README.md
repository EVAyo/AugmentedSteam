- Fine-tuned product search with search filters such as review count / score and Early Access
- Sort and filter options for the market, games, friends, groups, achievements, badges and reviews
- Links to popular websites with additional related information, plus the ability to add your own custom links
- Quick / Instant Sell items in your inventory
- Custom profile backgrounds and styles, visible to all users of Augmented Steam
- Take and store notes about any game
- Maximize information relevance by hiding unwanted content blocks from app pages or the homepage
